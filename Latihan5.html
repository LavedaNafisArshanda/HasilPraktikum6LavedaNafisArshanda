                     But I must explain to you how all this
                      mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                      praising pain was born and I will give you 
                      a complete account of the system, and expound 
                      the actual teachings of the great explorer of 
                      the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. 
                      No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
                      because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
                      know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
                       that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who 
                       loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because 
                       it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which
                        toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial 
                        example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except 
                        to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
                         a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
                          or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
